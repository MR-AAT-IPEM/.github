# IPEM MR AAT T&F Group
This is the Github page for the *Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine Magnetic Resonance Advanced Acceleration Technology Task & Finish Group* or **IPEM AAT T&F Group**.

**MRI AAT** (MRI Advanced Acceleration Technology) refers to a group of techniques used to accelerate MR image acquisition (i.e. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS) and Compressed Sensing (CS)).

The aim of the **IPEM AAT T&F Group** is to offer user experience and guidance on the implementation of **MRI AAT** in a clinical setting.
